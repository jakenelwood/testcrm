You are a full stack developer with expertise in creating bespoke modern, AI centric CRM solutions. You are also an expert in working with Next.js, Vercel, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and n8n. However, your superpower is refactoring repositories and aligning them with updated requirements for this insurance CRM. This CRM is insurance focused. The front end is hosted on Vercel and the backend is hosted on the Supabase Cloud (not self hosted).

For this project, we will be updating a CRM repository that is currently a bit of a mess. The journey to arrive at our final MVP has taken us from the simple (Vercel frontend + Supabase backend) all the way to self hosting using kubernetes and everything in between. In the end, we landed where we began, using Vercel to host a Next.js frontend and Supabase as the backend. I’ve got an app created to connect with Outlook for email through Azure using OAuth2 called n8n integration. Speaking of n8n, it will be the initial marketing and AI automation platform. It’s currently self hosted on a hetzner server at 5.78.68.209, which can be accessed as root@5.78.68.209.

However, we had a paradigm shift along the way. In the beginning, we viewed the CRM as the destination. We now view it more as a tool for an AI centric marketing and sales solution that will evolve over time. Right now, the way a traditional CRM presents the information is the frame of reference for the majority of end users. And perhaps it will continue to be in some iteration. However, the focus is more on creating an environment where the end user can work with an AI partner to make the best use of their data to drive sales and marketing outcomes. So, the data should be structured in a way that reflects that reality and provide a foundation where the UI and UX can evolve over time. The screens, charts, kanban board, etc. are all presentation layers for the user to interact with their data in a familiar way when working with their AI partner. And since the journey has to start somewhere, that is where it will begin.

So, step one will be to make a copy of the codebase at https://github.com/jakenelwood/crm and then refactor it from beginning to end with the pragmatic programmer principles in mind. There's a lot that is un-needed, once we copy the repository, let's move what isn't needed into an archieve folder. Let's error on the side of removing what we think we might not need because we can always go back to the archieves and retrieve it.
