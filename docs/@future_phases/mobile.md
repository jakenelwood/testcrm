## Frontend (Mobile & Desktop) üì±üíª ##
Framework: React Native is an excellent choice for a true "mobile-first" application. It allows you to build a single application in JavaScript/TypeScript that compiles to native iOS and Android apps.
Why it's strong: You maintain one primary codebase for both mobile platforms, which drastically reduces development and maintenance time.
Desktop/Web: Using a framework like Expo, you can extend your React Native codebase to run on the web, creating a PWA (Progressive Web App) or a full web dashboard for managers. This approach is more unified than managing a separate Next.js web app and a Tauri mobile app.
Backend ‚öôÔ∏è
Framework: NestJS (built on Node.js) is a superb choice. It uses TypeScript, which pairs perfectly with a React Native frontend, ensuring type safety across your entire stack.
Why it's strong: Its modular architecture is well-suited for complex applications. It enforces good design patterns, making the codebase scalable and maintainable. Its performance is excellent for handling API requests from many field agents simultaneously.
API: A GraphQL API, implemented with libraries like Apollo Server, would be highly efficient. It allows the mobile app to request only the exact data it needs, which is crucial for users on potentially slow cellular connections.
Database üóÑÔ∏è
System: PostgreSQL is the ideal relational database for this use case.
Why it's strong: It's famously reliable, scalable, and robust.
Geospatial Extension: The PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL is the key component here. It transforms your database into a powerful geospatial data server.
Why it's essential: PostGIS allows you to store geographic data (like customer locations) and perform complex spatial queries directly in the database (e.g., "find all clients within 5 miles of the agent's current location").
