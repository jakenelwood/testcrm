The three "missing" features are actually optional advanced features for multi-tenant architecture. Here's what they provide and when you might need them:

1. Organizations Table
What it does:

Creates separate "companies" or "agencies" within your CRM
Each organization has its own data, settings, and users
Supports different organization types: Individual, Agency, Enterprise
When you need it:

SaaS Model: Multiple insurance agencies using your CRM
Enterprise: Large companies with multiple departments/branches
White-label: Offering branded CRM to different agencies
What you get without it:

Single-tenant system (one company/agency)
All users share the same data space
Simpler setup, perfect for individual agencies
2. Organization Roles
What it does:

Custom roles per organization (beyond basic user/admin)
Organization-specific permissions
Role templates that can be customized per agency
Example roles:

Insurance Agency: Owner, Manager, Senior Agent, Junior Agent, Assistant
Enterprise: Department Head, Team Lead, Specialist, Intern
When you need it:

Complex organizational hierarchies
Different agencies with different role structures
Granular permission control per organization
What you get without it:

System-wide roles (user, admin, agent, manager)
Simpler permission model
Easier to manage for smaller teams
3. User Organization Memberships
What it does:

Links users to specific organizations
Users can belong to multiple organizations
Tracks invitation history and membership status
When you need it:

Users working across multiple agencies
Consultants or contractors with access to several companies
Franchise models with shared resources
What you get without it:

All users belong to the same "organization"
Simpler user management
Direct user-to-data relationships
🤔 Do You Need Multi-Tenant Features?
✅ You DON'T need them if:
Building for a single insurance agency
Small to medium team (under 50 users)
Everyone works with the same data
Simple role structure (agents, managers, admins)
🏢 You DO need them if:
Building a SaaS product for multiple agencies
Large enterprise with separate departments
Franchise model with independent locations
Need to isolate data between different companies
🚀 Migration Path
Good news: You can add multi-tenant features later without breaking existing functionality!

Current State (Single-Tenant)
Future State (Multi-Tenant)
Adding Multi-Tenant Later
Apply organization migrations when needed
Migrate existing data to default organization
Update permissions to use organization context
Zero downtime migration possible
💡 Recommendation
Start single-tenant unless you specifically need multi-tenancy from day one. The authentication system you have now is:

✅ Production-ready for single organizations
✅ Scalable to hundreds of users
✅ Secure with proper permissions
✅ Upgradeable to multi-tenant when needed
You can always add the organization features later as your business grows or if you decide to offer your CRM as a SaaS product to other agencies.

Focus on building your core insurance CRM features first - leads, clients, quotes, policies, communications. The authentication foundation is solid! 🎯
