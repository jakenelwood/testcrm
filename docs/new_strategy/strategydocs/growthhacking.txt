This isn't a fair fight, and that's our advantage. The incumbents—Salesforce,
HubSpot—are fat, slow, and arrogant. They are trapped by legacy architecture,
shareholder expectations, and a fundamental disrespect for their users' data. We're
not going to out-spend them. We're going to out-maneuver them by turning their
greatest strengths—their massive data moats—into their greatest weaknesses.
The Attack Vector: Weaponizing Incumbent Weaknesses
Our entire market position is built on being the antithesis of the incumbent
experience. The strategy is to identify every point of user frustration with Salesforce
and HubSpot and build our product and messaging as the direct, explicit solution. This
isn't subtle. We will name names.
The existing CRM landscape is a goldmine of user rage, particularly against features
like Salesforce Einstein Activity Capture (EAC). The core complaints are a strategic
gift. Users are furious that their activity data is not stored in their own Salesforce
instance but on third-party AWS servers.1 This data is then purged after a maximum of
24 months, with a default of only six.1 This means businesses do not truly own their
data; if they ever decide to migrate away from EAC, their captured history is
permanently deleted.1
This architectural choice renders standard reporting impossible on what is essentially
"visualized" data, not actual records in their database.1 Customization is practically
non-existent, with no support for custom objects and rigid, unchangeable syncing
rules.1 HubSpot users voice similar frustrations, describing its AI features as feeling
"half-baked" or like a superficial attempt to "check a box for the investors".4
This isn't just a list of bad features; it's a pattern of behavior that reveals a deeper
vulnerability. These companies treat customer data as a resource to be harvested for
their proprietary AI models, not as a sovereign asset to be protected for the
customer.2 The reason user data is stored off-site and deleted is that Salesforce's
analytics architecture was built to serve their AI, not the user's reporting needs.2 This
has created a deep well of distrust. The core vulnerability of the incumbents is not
technical, but philosophical. They have broken the trust covenant with their users.
This creates an emotional and political pain point that is far more powerful than any
feature-to-feature comparison.
Our most potent growth lever, therefore, isn't a marginally better algorithm; it's a
fundamentally different promise. Marketing will not lead with "smarter insights." It will

lead with "Your Data, Your Control, Forever." This message directly targets the sense
of betrayal users feel.
Actionable Tactics:
●​ Product Architecture: The use of a dedicated Supabase Postgres database for

each customer is our fortress. This will be messaged explicitly: "Your data lives in
your own dedicated Postgres instance. We don't see it, we don't touch it, we can't
delete it. You have full SQL access anytime." This is a direct counter-attack on the
AWS black box of EAC.1
●​ Core Messaging: The landing page headline will be a variation of: "The AI CRM
That Puts You Back in Control." Sub-headings will directly address the pain points:
"Your Data, Not Ours," "Reporting on Everything," and "AI That Works For You, Not
Against You."
●​ Onboarding: The first screen after signup will reinforce this promise: "Welcome.
Your dedicated, secure database is now provisioned. You have full SQL access.
Let's import your data."
This strategy is codified in the following battlecard, which will serve as the central
reference for all marketing, sales, and product copy. It ensures message discipline
across the entire company, creating a powerful, consistent narrative that hammers
home our advantage.

The PLG Engine: From Freemium to Fanatic
A Product-Led Growth (PLG) model with a powerful freemium tier will be used to
obliterate the friction of adoption.8 The goal is not just to acquire users, but to create
fanatics. The product itself will be the primary driver of acquisition, conversion, and
expansion. This model is effective because it lowers the barrier to entry and allows
users to experience value before paying, as demonstrated by companies like Dropbox
and Zoom.9 The key is to shift the focus from Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) to
Product Qualified Leads (PQLs)—users who have experienced the "Aha!" moment and
are showing signs of deep engagement.12

The freemium tier's primary purpose is not just user acquisition, but data acquisition
for the user. Traditional CRMs are empty boxes that require tedious manual data entry
before they provide any value. We will bypass this entirely. By making it incredibly easy
for a user to sync their email and calendar, we solve an immediate pain point and
simultaneously populate their CRM with the very data our AI needs to demonstrate its
value. The "Aha!" moment is seeing a genuinely useful, AI-generated insight about
their own data within the first 15 minutes of use.
This creates a powerful hook that traditional CRMs cannot replicate. Once a user
connects their accounts, the backend—using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large—will
immediately analyze their communication data to find a "golden nugget" insight. For
example: "You've emailed with Jane from Acme Corp 12 times this month, but haven't
scheduled a follow-up. The last email sentiment was positive. Suggest creating a task
to schedule a call?" This insight, presented on the user's dashboard, demonstrates
the power of AI on their own data without any manual work. This creates a powerful
incentive to keep using the free product and explore what else it can do, leading them
naturally toward the PQL triggers.
Actionable Tactics:
●​ Freemium Tier Definition:
○​ Free Forever: Up to 500 contacts, single user, full email/calendar sync, basic

AI-powered contact enrichment, and 3 AI-generated "Smart Insights" per
week.
○​ Value Proposition: "Organize your contacts and get AI-powered insights,
completely free."
●​ PQL Triggers: These events, tracked in the Supabase backend, will signal that a
user is ready for an upgrade. They include:
○​ Inviting a team member.
○​ Creating over 25 manual contacts or deals.
○​ Clicking on a "Pro" feature call-to-action (e.g., "Unlock Advanced Sales
Forecasting").
○​ Approaching the 500-contact limit.
○​ These triggers will fire off automated, personalized upgrade prompts via
in-app messages and email.8
●​ Onboarding Flow:
1.​ Signup: Minimal fields, with Google/Microsoft single sign-on.
2.​ Immediate Prompt: The single most important action is to get the user to

connect their email with the prompt: "Connect your email to unlock
AI-powered insights."
3.​ Background Processing: As they explore the UI, the AI gets to work.
4.​ Dashboard Reveal: The first "Smart Insight" appears, demonstrating
immediate value.
5.​ Interactive Tour: A short, interactive tour highlights three core features,
including where to find more insights and how to add a deal, guiding the user
without being overwhelming.8

Engineering Virality: Shareable Insights & Collaborative Hooks
Virality will be baked into the product's core functionality. The product must be a
vehicle for its own distribution, achieved through two primary mechanisms: valuable,
shareable artifacts and collaboration-dependent features.9 Viral loops work when an
existing user exposes the product to a new user as a natural part of using it, as seen
with Zoom and Google Docs, where collaboration is the viral vector.9
In a B2B context, the most powerful viral artifact is one that makes the user look smart
and prepared in front of their boss or colleagues. A "Shareable Report" feature that
generates a clean, data-rich summary of sales activities or pipeline health, branded
with a subtle "Generated by," becomes a Trojan horse. The user gets credit for the
analysis, and the brand gets exposure to a new, highly qualified audience—the user's
manager and team. This is a "Casual Contact Viral Loop," where new users are
exposed to the product's value indirectly, which is more powerful than a direct ad
because it comes with the implicit endorsement of their colleague.16
Actionable Tactics:
●​ Feature: "Weekly Pulse" Shareable Report:
○​ A one-click button in the dashboard: "Generate Weekly Pulse Report."
○​ The report will be a clean, well-designed webpage (rendered server-side with

Next.js for speed and SEO) or a downloadable PDF.
○​ Content will include valuable metrics like "Top 5 Most Engaged Contacts,"
"Deals Needing Attention," "Team Activity Leaderboard," and "Pipeline
Forecast."
○​ Subtle branding—"Generated with"—will be placed at the bottom with a
hyperlink that includes referral parameters for tracking.17
○​ Easy sharing options for Slack, email, and link copying will be provided.14

●​ Feature: Collaborative Deal Rooms:
○​ For any "Deal" in the CRM, a user can create a "Shared Deal Room"—a simple,

shared space for notes, files, and key contacts.
○​ To collaborate, they must invite colleagues via email. The invite template
reads: "[User Name] has invited you to collaborate on the '' in."
○​ This creates an "Inherent Viral Loop," where the core functionality of
collaboration drives new user signups.14 Invited users get a limited "guest"
view and are prompted to sign up for a full free account to participate fully.

Content as a Magnet: The Data-Driven SEO Strategy
We will dominate search results for high-intent, long-tail keywords related to the
specific, documented failures of our competitors. The content will not be generic fluff.
It will be sharp, technical, and solution-oriented, acting as a beacon for frustrated
users of other CRMs. The Next.js stack is an SEO powerhouse and must be fully
leveraged with server-side rendering, dynamic metadata, semantic HTML, and image
optimization to achieve perfect PageSpeed scores.19
Long-tail keywords have lower competition and higher conversion rates because they
target users with specific intent who are closer to a purchasing decision.22 The most
valuable content to create is a "migration guide." For every major pain point in
Salesforce or HubSpot, a detailed, step-by-step tutorial will be created, titled
something like "How to Fix by Migrating to." This positions the product not as an
alternative, but as the
solution. It captures users at their moment of maximum frustration and intent to
switch. The tutorial will be genuinely helpful, but the ultimate solution presented will
be "...or, you can do this in one click with our free tool." This "teach to reach" strategy
builds immense trust and authority.25
Actionable Tactics:
●​ Content Pillar Strategy:
○​ Pillar 1: The "Escape Plan" Series. A collection of articles and videos directly

targeting competitor weaknesses. Examples: "A Step-by-Step Guide to
Reporting on Einstein Activity Capture Data (The Hard Way and The Easy
Way)," "Tired of HubSpot's Black Box AI? Here's How to Get Transparent
Insights."

○​ Pillar 2: The "Data-Driven Sales" Playbook. Content focused on our

strengths. Examples: "Using Postgres in Your CRM for Unlimited
Customization," "5 Actionable Sales Insights You Can Generate with AI in 5
Minutes."
●​ Technical SEO Implementation:
○​ Use next/head to dynamically generate unique <title> and <meta
name="description"> tags for every page.19
○​ Create programmatic SEO pages for competitor comparisons (e.g.,
[our-crm]-vs-salesforce).
○​ Automatically generate a sitemap.xml and ensure all pages use canonical
URLs to prevent duplicate content issues.19

Monetization: The Value-Aligned Pricing Ladder

The pricing will be simple, transparent, and directly aligned with the value the
customer receives. A feature- and usage-based tiered subscription model will make it
a no-brainer to start and provide a clear, logical path to upgrade as the customer's
business grows.26
The most critical psychological component of the pricing is the "Free" tier. It must be
genuinely useful to build trust and fuel the PLG engine. The paid tiers should be
differentiated by a single, clear value metric that customers understand and associate
with growth: "How much of the AI's brain are you using?" This can be proxied with a
combination of contacts, users, and advanced feature access. The value metric
shouldn't be confusing (like "AI tokens"). It should be tied to business outcomes. The
free tier gets descriptive AI ("This happened"). The pro tier gets predictive AI ("This is
likely to happen"). The enterprise tier gets prescriptive AI ("Here's what you should do
about it"). This aligns pricing directly with the sophistication of the value delivered,
making the upsell conversation easy.
Actionable Tactics:
●​ Proposed Pricing Tiers:
○​ Free: $0. For individuals and solopreneurs. Limits: 1 User, 500 Contacts.

Features: Core CRM, Email/Calendar Sync, Basic Contact Enrichment,
Descriptive AI Insights.

○​ Pro: $49/user/month. For small teams (2-10). Limits: 5 Users included, 5,000
