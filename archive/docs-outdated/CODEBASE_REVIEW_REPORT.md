- Commented-out code in some files
- Band-aid fixes in build configuration

**Action Plan:**
1. Convert all TODO comments to tracked issues
2. Remove commented-out code
3. Address root causes of build configuration workarounds

### 9. Help Me Debug with Insight, Not Guesswork ‚úÖ
**Status:** EXCELLENT  
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive logging throughout the application

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. Testing Infrastructure (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue:** No comprehensive test suite for critical business logic  
**Impact:** Risk of regressions, difficult debugging, reduced confidence in deployments  
**Solution:** Implement Jest + React Testing Library test suite

### 2. TypeScript Strict Mode (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue:** Strict mode disabled reducing type safety  
**Impact:** Potential runtime errors, reduced IDE support, maintenance difficulties  
**Solution:** Gradually enable strict mode and fix type issues

### 3. Build Configuration (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Issue:** Build errors and TypeScript errors ignored  
**Impact:** Hidden issues that could surface in production  
**Solution:** Address root causes of build warnings

```bash
# Quick fix for immediate improvement
1. Replace `any` with proper interfaces
2. Add type definitions for form data structures
3. Implement proper type guards
```

### Priority 2: Enable Testing Infrastructure (Next Week)
```bash
# Install testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

# Create basic test configuration

# Gradual enablement following docs/TYPESCRIPT_STRICT_MODE_MIGRATION.md
npx tsc --noEmit --strict  # Check current issues first
```

### Quick Wins (Today)
1. **Fix form-transformers.ts types** - Replace `any` with proper interfaces
